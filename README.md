# Food Image Classification with PyTorch  

##  Project Overview  
This project is a **Deep Learning-based Food Image Classifier** built using **PyTorch**. The model is trained on a custom dataset of food images and can classify different food items. It uses **transfer learning**, **data augmentation**, and **PyTorchâ€™s training pipeline** for efficient model training and evaluation.

| File                  | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `data_setup.py`      | Handles dataset loading, transformations, and creating train/test dataloaders. |
| `model.py`          | Defines the deep learning model architecture used for image classification. |
| `train.py`          | Main script for training the model, including argument parsing, data loading, and model initialization. |
| `training_pipeline.py` | Contains functions for training and evaluating the model, including loss calculation and performance metrics. |
| `utils.py`          | Helper function for model saving/loading. |

Each file plays a crucial role in ensuring the model is trained efficiently and can be used for inference later.  


## Features  
âœ… **Custom Dataset Handling** â€“ Loads and preprocesses images.  
âœ… **Data Augmentation** â€“ Uses transformations for better generalization.  
âœ… **Transfer Learning** â€“ Fine-tunes a pre-trained model.  
âœ… **GPU Support** â€“ Trains efficiently using CUDA if available.

## Installation  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
https://github.com/Piyal-Banik/Food-Image-Classifier.git

```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Train the Model
```bash
python train.py --train_dir path/to/train --test_dir path/to/test --num_epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.001
```

| Argument        | Description                                      | Default |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--train_dir`  | Path to the training dataset                     | Required |
| `--test_dir`   | Path to the test dataset                         | Required |
| `--num_epochs` | Number of epochs for training                    | `5` |
| `--batch_size` | Batch size for training                          | `32` |
| `--learning_rate` | Learning rate for optimizer                  | `0.001` |
| `--img_size`   | Image size for resizing (assumes square images)  | `224` |
| `--device`     | Device to train on (`auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`)       | `auto` |

### Evaluate the Model
After training, the model is automatically evaluated on the test dataset. To manually test, modify training_pipeline.py to evaluate on custom images.

### Save & Load Model
The trained model is saved as model.pth.

To load the trained model for inference:
```bash
import torch
from model import FoodImageClassifier

# Load model
model = FoodImageClassifier(fine_tune=False, num_classes=3)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
model.eval()

```

### Run Inference on New Images
Modify utils.py to load an image and predict its class. Example usage:
```bash
from utils import predict_image

image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
prediction = predict_image(model, image_path)
print(f"Predicted class: {prediction}")
```

## ðŸ“Š Results and Evaluation

The model was trained for **5 epochs** on the dataset. Below are the recorded training and testing metrics:

### Training Progress

| Epoch | Train Loss | Train Accuracy | Test Loss | Test Accuracy|
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1     | 0.6528    | 80.47%        | 0.4021    | 89.77%       | 
| 2     | 0.3343    | 84.77%        | 0.6698    | 88.73%       |
| 3     | 0.1721    | 87.11%        | 0.5694    | 91.76%       |
| 4     | 0.1289    | 97.66%        | 0.3296    | 91.86%       |
| 5     | 0.5630    | 85.94%        | 0.2259    | 92.80%       |

### ðŸ”¹ Key Observations:
- **Test Accuracy Improved Over Epochs**: The best test accuracy of **92.80%** was achieved at **Epoch 5**.
- **Model Checkpointing**: The model was saved whenever a new best test accuracy was achieved.
- **Overfitting Check**: While the training accuracy reached **97.66% at Epoch 4**, test accuracy increased marginally from **91.86% to 92.80%**, suggesting potential overfitting.
- **Final Model Saved**: The final trained model is stored in `models/model.pth`.
